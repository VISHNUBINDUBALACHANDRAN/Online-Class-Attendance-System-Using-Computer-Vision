# Online-Class-Attendance-System-Using-Computer-Vision
This project aims to use facial recognition technology to establish an attendance system for online classes in this challenging Covid19 environment. SVM classification algorithm is used for the classification process. The attendance was recorded live on an excel sheet using a webcam to recognise faces. This project makes use of the OpenCV Library.
